Simulation for the paths of neutrons through different materials using a voxel simulation in MATLAB. The woodcock method is used for the tracking. In Voxel.m is a selection of example setups which can be uncommented to test out or used to design your own. GetMat and ColourMat can be used to add new materials by adding in their relevant mass, density and cross sections and ColourMat allows a different colour to be used in the visualisation.

Run Voxel.m to perform the simulation
